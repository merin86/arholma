-   Front Page

    - The front page mostly consists of the "hero" image with a strip of text that together wants to give the impression of calm and harmony on the island. The color theme is matte, which also generates a calm impression for the user.
    - The two buttons, placed directly below the image, create clarity for the user about what the website has to offer.

The third is a location dot, a link to Google Maps where you can plan your journey by yourself.

    - The page uses a consistent look and feel by using the same background image used for the front page, and by applying the same background color to the panels as used on the main page text strip.
