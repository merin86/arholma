-   Front Page

    - The front page consists of the "hero" image with a strip of text that together wants to give the impression of calm and harmony on the island and a text box with information about the island. The color theme is matte, which also generates a calm impression for the user.
    - The two buttons, placed directly below the text, create clarity for the user about what the website has to offer.

- Footer

    - The Footer is visible on all pages and always looks the same to be user-friendly. It consists of a text: "How to get there", with three icons underneath. The first icon is a bus, a link that takes you to SL.se where you can search for bus tours. The second icon is a boat, a link to Waxholmsbolaget where you can search for boat trips. The third is a location dot, a link to Google Maps where you can plan your journey by yourself.

- Hostels

    - The hostel page gives a brief summary of what the three different hostels to choose from have to offer. To clarify the content for the user, the hostels have been divided into three panels. The hostels to choose from are: "Arholma Nord", "Bull August" and "Österhamns pensionat".
    - The page uses a consistent look and feel by using the same background image used for the front page, with the exception of smaller screens (mobile phones) as the image was too stretched in this format. The same background colour was applied to the panels as used on the main page text strip for cohesion.

## Design

-   Wireframe

    - Wireframe used as a starting point for the design of the website.

- Colour
    - The main color used in the project can be seen below. It is a dull green color to give a calm and harmonious impression. In addition to this, only black and white have been used, as well as a grayer scale for shadows. On the hostel page, a light blue background was used on small screens.

- Typography

    - Google Fonts was used to import Poppins and Sintony fonts into styles.css. These were chosen as they work well together and are easy to read.
