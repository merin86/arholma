            <h1>Welcome to Arholma</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Arholma is an island in the Stockholm archipelago. The island has a long history and has undergone
                changes over the years. Only about 30 years ago there were over 70 permanent residents on the
                island. Today, that figure is closer to 30 or 40 permanent residents. Nowadays, most of the houses
                are owned by summer guests and during the summer there are close to 500 people living on the island.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Here there is a grocery store that is open all year round, a church and various community functions
                such as garbage collection, mail delivery, etc. A passenger boat goes to the mainland, at fixed
                times, a couple of times a day (more frequently during the summer).
            </p>

                Summer time:
                Several hostels open and there are restaurants and cafes. Various different activities are also
                offered on the island, such as cultural events, kayak rentals, saunas and much more. Various
                activities are also arranged for children, such as football practice, dance and drum lessons and
                theatres. Arholma is known for its midsummer celebration, with its distinctive midsummer pole, when
                many guests visit the island. There is also a song about the island, <a
